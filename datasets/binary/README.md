# Description
These datasets have not been scaled, whitened or other type of preprocessing that
affects the data. They have only been put into the `csv` format. Additionally we
have set the last column to be either the values 0 or 1. All credit goes to the dataset
creators. I have only uploaded them if someone wants to try them out. I have done the
'encoding' using the `labelencoder.py` tool in the root directory.
